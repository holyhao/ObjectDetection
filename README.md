# ObjectDetection
ObjectDetection-PyTorch
Thanks to torchcv https://github.com/kuangliu/torchcv/.
Due to some error in original torchcv, I corrected it and push this.

My pretrained model was in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-1lqrUE2UHuPeKFuLOaxxXh0UgITBWf/view?usp=sharing) which can got around 76mAP now. One can check the training and eval log in [log](https://github.com/silkylove/ObjectDetection/tree/master/example/fpnssd/log).
